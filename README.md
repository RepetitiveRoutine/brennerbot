## Requirements
- [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- [Wavelink Server](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink)
- API Keys:
   - [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) - for GPT-3 integration ($18 free credit on signup) ü§ñ
   - [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) - To support spotify tracks, albums and playlists in the music player üìª

## Getting Started 

### Cloning the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:br3nr/brennerbot.git
cd brennerbot
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Adding the API keys & Bot Tokens
Before you can run the program, you need to include your discord bot token (See [Creating your bot](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) if you do not have this.) 

The bot token is needed in `bot.py`. Replace the line:

```py
client.run(os.environ["DISCORD_TOKEN"])
``` 

with,
```py
client.run("YOUR TOKEN GOES HERE")
```

Spotify integration requires two keys, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET. You can access these by creating a spotify application in the [developer portal](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). These keys need to be set in `music.py`: 

```py
def __init__(self, bot: commands.Bot):
        self.cid = "YOUR CLIENT ID HERE"
        self.csecret = "YOUR CLIENT SECRET HERE"
```

The same goes for the OpenAI API key in `gpt.py`:

```py
def __init__(self, bot: commands.Bot):
        self.bot = bot
        self.model_engine = "text-davinci-002"
        openai.api_key = "YOUR OPEN API KEY HERE"
```

## Running the bot
This bot requires a Wavelink server to be running in the background. This needs to be running alongside the discord bot. Please visit the [Wavelink repo](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink) for more information. 

To launch the server, run the following command:
```
java -jar Lavalink.jar
```

Finally, the bot can be launched in a separate terminal using:
```
python3 bot.py
```
